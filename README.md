
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.1 
-----

Tidy dataset created by Nicolas Mouquet for the Getting and Clening data coursera session 2017

Original data from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws www.smartlab.ws


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

See 'features_info.txt' for more details on the sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) that were measured; 


###The repo includes the following files:

- 'data.zip' with the original dataset 
- 'README.txt'
